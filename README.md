#A Triple Diffie-Hellman implementation in C

This is a triple DH exchange implementation in C, using libgcrypt. It also uses
the existing "classic" diffie hellman implementation of [libotr](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/)
but with some additional functions.

**This code is *NOT* tested and therefore it is *NOT* suitable for any application
that needs to be even remotely secure**
